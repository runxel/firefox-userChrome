# firefox-userChrome
**UPDATE**  
From Firefox 69 on you will need to set a flag in `about:config`. Otherwise the userChrome will be disabled.  
Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`to `true`.  
_However_: It seems that `moz-binding` was disabled as well, which means you can't style the scrollbars anymore... :(

This is my current configuration of the Firefox userChrome (located in your profile folder â€“ yes, you have this, too).  
What's awesome here is it even styles the scrollbars!
